# validated-patterns-demos
This is a learning and demonstrations repo that uses [validated patterns](https://validated-patterns.io). 
The demos vary. Some have been used to boost my knowledge, some to test particular functionality in test environments.

This was build off of the core [Multicloud GitOps](http://validated-patterns.io/multicloud-gitops/) pattern. Refer to the core instructions on bootstrappng clusters.

## Required / tested infrastructure
This system has been tested on an OpenShift Cluster. Both [ROSA](https://aws.amazon.com/rosa/) on AWS and [ROCS](https://www.ibm.com/products/openshift) on [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com) have been used as host systems.
